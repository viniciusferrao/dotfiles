# dotfiles
Just a backup of my essentials dotfiles. Nothing really fancy.

To reinstall the dotfiles just move the cloned directory to .dotfiles and run `stow` in each folders inside the .dotfiles directory.

As obvious requirements:
* stow
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh
* (aiiiin meu zsh)
* thefuck
* macOS (yeah, screw Linux)
* anything else that I probably forgot because I don't git clone this everyday, my Gentoo days are long gone.
